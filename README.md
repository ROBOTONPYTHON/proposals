## How to contribute to Keng Lernitas Ecosystem Proposals

### Contributing


The Keng Lernitas Ecosystem, which governs the tokens $2192 and $ZORKSEES deployed on Optimism, Base, and Solana, uses KLEIPs (Keng Lernitas Ecosystem Improvement Proposals), with the KLEIP Proposal template being the first proposal of its category that specifically highlights the use-case and function.

Contributors should then look to make a fork of the this repository where they will write their proposal. Your first PR should be a final draft of the final proposal. It must then meet the correct formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header).

An editor will then manually review the first PR for a new proposal. After the PR has been merged into the site, a public Telegram (and Discord in the future!) pinned post must be arranged with the Keng Lernitas Ecosystem. This presentation is necessary for gathering community feedback on relevant proposals.

Once the proposal is assessed and mature enough to move into a vote, reach out to the Proposals Editor who can be found in the Keng Lernitas Telegram (and Discord in the future!). A vote will now be set-up:

KLEIPs are voted on by eligible participants on snapshot.org. If a vote reaches a majority, the proposal is moved to Approved, otherwise it is Rejected.

Once the proposal has been implemented by either the Keng Lernitas Ecosystem Developers, proposal author, or any other relevant parties, the proposal is assigned to Implemented status.
