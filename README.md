## How to contribute to Keng Lernitas Ecosystem Proposals

### Contributing

Before contributors begin writing their proposals, clearly identify what type of proposal you intend to make: KLEIPs. Proposal templates, which are the first proposal of each category, specifically highlight their use-case and function.

Contributors should then look to make a fork of the this repository where they will write their proposal. Your first PR should be a final draft of the final proposal. It must then meet the correct formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header).

An editor will then manually review the first PR for a new proposal. After the PR has been merged into the site, a public Discord AMA presentation must be arranged with the Keng Lernitas Ecosystem Council. This presentation is necessary for gathering community feedback on relevant proposals.

Once the proposal is assessed and mature enough to move into a vote, reach out to the Proposals Editor who can be found in the Keng Lernitas Telegram. A vote will now be set-up:

- For KLEIPs, proposals are voted on by eligible participants on snapshot.org. If a vote reaches a majority, the proposal is moved to Approved, otherwise it is Rejected.

Once the proposal has been implemented by either the Keng Lernitas Ecosystem DAO, proposal author, or any other relevant parties, the proposal is assigned the Implemented status.
